Experiment 2 - Heuristic Improvement

num_nodes set to 100 for mcts_vanilla and mcts_modified
Final win counts: {'draw': 14, 1: 38, 2: 48}
522.9741766  seconds

The modified MCTS (player 2 in sample) bot does win more games than the vanilla
MCTS bot out of 100 games played.
Yes, the more trees the modified bot has over the vanilla bot, 
the better values it will be able to find while expanding its tree.
Increasing the tree size should help modified win more given the same time to
take its turn due to its heuristic application to narrow down better choices.
