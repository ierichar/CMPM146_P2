Experiment 3 - Time as a Constraint

Final win counts: {'draw': 34, 1: 31, 2: 35}

With our experiment on both trees, the modified tree is smaller than the vanilla.
We think that it is due to the introduction of heuristics into our rollout funciton.
With different time limits, the longer you give the heuristic-using bot, the better results it should produce so it can narrow down better selections
